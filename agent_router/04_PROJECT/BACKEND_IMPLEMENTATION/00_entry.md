# BACKEND_IMPLEMENTATION — Modules

This content was split into smaller modules for token-optimized assistant reads.

Start with `AGENTS.md` (repo root) and `docs/agent_router/00_AUTHORITY.md` for intent routing.

- Canonical sync 2026-03-09: navigation/TOC and frontmatter normalization propagation refresh.
- Review-event contracts (`mark_reviewed`, `unmark_reviewed`, `field_edited`, `field_reassigned`) are authoritative in this module set.
- Calibration-store contracts for (`context_key`, `field_key`, `mapping_id`) ownership are maintained under backend implementation modules.
- Confidence-calibration observability requirements (old/new confidence and policy-state transitions) are owned in backend implementation modules.
- Naming alignment propagated: canonical layer label is `infra (infrastructure)` and must match code location under `backend/app/infra/`.
