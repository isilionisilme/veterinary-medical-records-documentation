# UX_DESIGN — Modules

This content was split into smaller modules for token-optimized assistant reads.

Start with `AGENTS.md` (repo root) and `docs/agent_router/00_AUTHORITY.md` for intent routing.

- Canonical sync 2026-03-09: navigation/TOC and frontmatter normalization propagation refresh.
- UX confidence semantics distinguish `candidate_confidence` (diagnostic) from `field_mapping_confidence` (veterinarian-facing signal).
- Reviewed-toggle behavior and implicit unchanged-field weak-positive signal contracts are reflected in UX owner modules.
- Medical Record panel rendering remains contract-driven (`medical_record_view`, `field_slots`, `visits[]`, `other_fields[]`) with no UI-side heuristics.
